# Entity Order

This Foundry VTT module allows you to re-order entities (Actors, Scenes, Items and Journal entries).

# Installation
Extract the entityorder.zip file to the public/modules directory. As DM go to the `Manage Modules` options menu in your World ('?' icon on the side bar) then enable the `Entity Order` module.

# Using it
Just drag and drop your entities and they should get placed wherever you drop them. To place one at the top of a folder, drop it onto the folder name itself. An entity will always be placed after the entity you drop it onto.
